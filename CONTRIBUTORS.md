# Python Stream Doeck Library

Python Stream Doeck Library is being developed by Lisias T over previous work from the following projects:

* [StreamController/streamcontroller-python-elgato-streamdeck](https://github.com/StreamController/streamcontroller-python-elgato-streamdeck/)
* [abcminiuser/python-elgato-streamdeck](https://github.com/abcminiuser/python-elgato-streamdeck/)

And it's unlikely that I would even had bought these devices without them at first place.


## Contributors

The original author [abcminiuser](https://github.com/abcminiuser) used the reverse engineering notes from [this GitHub](https://github.com/alvancamp/node-elgato-stream-deck/blob/master/NOTES.md) repository to implement this library. Thanks Alex Van Camp!

Additional thanks to [Core477](https://github.com/Core447) for the idea of simulating double action events (`Button Down` & `Button Up`) on Mirabox devices, as well kick starting suport for them.

Further information and cross checking were possible thanks to the projects:

* [bitfocus/companion](https://github.com/bitfocus/companion/blob/main/companion/lib/Surface/USB/MiraboxStreamDock.ts)
* [rigor789/mirabox-streamdock-node](https://github.com/rigor789/mirabox-streamdock-node/blob/main/src/streamdock.ts)
* [streamduck-org/elgato-streamdeck](https://github.com/streamduck-org/elgato-streamdeck/blob/main/src/lib.rs)
