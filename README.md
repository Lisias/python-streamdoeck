# Python Stream Doeck Library

<img src="./doc/imgs/ExampleDeck.jpg" height="250"/> <img src="./doc/imgs/Mirabox-263S.jpg" height="250"/>

This is an open source Python 3 library to control both [Elgato Stream Deck](https://www.elgato.com/en/gaming/stream-deck) as well the [Mirabox Stream Dock](https://miraboxbuy.com/collections/stream-dock) knock offs (and some exclusives) directly, without the official software. This can allow you to create your own custom front-ends, such as a custom control front-end for home automation software.

> [!NOTE]  
> This is a fork of [StreamController/streamcontroller-python-elgato-streamdeck](https://github.com/StreamController/streamcontroller-python-elgato-streamdeck), that on its turn it's a form from [abcminiuser/python-elgato-streamdeck](https://github.com/https://github.com/abcminiuser/python-elgato-streamdeck).

## Why "Doeck" ?

Because it supports both Elgato's Stream D**e**ck and Mirabox's Stream D**o**ck - I was tempted to name this "Stream Dick Library" (since "i" would be the middle ground between "e" and "o"), but Common SenseÂ© prevailed. ðŸ˜…
